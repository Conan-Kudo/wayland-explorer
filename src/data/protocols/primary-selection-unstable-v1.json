This primary selection is a shortcut to the\n    common clipboard selection, where text just needs to be selected in order\n    to allow copying it elsewhere. The de facto way to perform this action\n    is the middle mouse button, although it is not limited to this one.\n\n    Clients wishing to honor primary selection should create a primary\n    selection source and set it as the selection through\n    wp_primary_selection_device.set_selection whenever the text selection\n    changes. In order to minimize calls in pointer-driven text selection,\n    it should happen only once after the operation finished. Similarly,\n    a NULL source should be set when text is unselected.\n\n    wp_primary_selection_offer objects are first announced through the\n    wp_primary_selection_device.data_offer event. Immediately after this event,\n    the primary data offer will emit wp_primary_selection_offer.offer events\n    to let know of the mime types being offered.\n\n    When the primary selection changes, the client with the keyboard focus\n    will receive wp_primary_selection_device.selection events. Only the client\n    with the keyboard focus will receive such events with a non-NULL\n    wp_primary_selection_offer. Across keyboard focus changes, previously\n    focused clients will receive wp_primary_selection_device.events with a\n    NULL wp_primary_selection_offer.\n\n    In order to request the primary selection data, the client must pass\n    a recent serial pertaining to the press event that is triggering the\n    operation, if the compositor deems the serial valid and recent, the\n    wp_primary_selection_source.send event will happen in the other end\n    to let the transfer begin. The client owning the primary selection\n    should write the requested data, and close the file descriptor\n    immediately.\n\n    If the primary selection owner client disappeared during the transfer,\n    the client reading the data will receive a\n    wp_primary_selection_device.selection event with a NULL\n    wp_primary_selection_offer, the client should take this as a hint\n    to finish the reads related to the no longer existing offer.\n\n    The primary selection owner should be checking for errors during\n    writes, merely cancelling the ongoing transfer if any happened.","summary":"Primary selection protocol"},"interfaces":[{"type":"interface","name":"zwp_primary_selection_device_manager_v1","version":"1","description":{"type":"description","text":"The primary selection device manager is a singleton global object that\n      provides access to the primary selection.
