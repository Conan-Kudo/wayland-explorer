Immediately after a client binds to this interface,\n      the set of supported formats and format modifiers is sent with\n      'format' and 'modifier' events.\n\n      The following are required from clients:\n\n      - Clients must ensure that either all data in the dma-buf is\n        coherent for all subsequent read access or that coherency is\n        correctly handled by the underlying kernel-side dma-buf\n        implementation.\n\n      - Don't make any more attachments after sending the buffer to the\n        compositor. Making more attachments later increases the risk of\n        the compositor not being able to use (re-import) an existing\n        dmabuf-based wl_buffer.\n\n      The underlying graphics stack must ensure the following:\n\n      - The dmabuf file descriptors relayed to the server will stay valid\n        for the whole lifetime of the wl_buffer. This means the server may\n        at any time use those fds to import the dmabuf into any kernel\n        sub-system that might accept it.\n\n      However, when the underlying graphics stack fails to deliver the\n      promise, because of e.g. a device hot-unplug which raises internal\n      errors, after the wl_buffer has been successfully created the\n      compositor must not raise protocol errors to the client when dmabuf\n      import later fails.\n\n      To create a wl_buffer from one or more dmabufs, a client creates a\n      zwp_linux_dmabuf_params_v1 object with a zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1.create_params\n      request. All planes required by the intended format are added with\n      the 'add' request. Finally, a 'create' or 'create_immed' request is\n      issued, which has the following outcome depending on the import success.\n\n      The 'create' request,\n      - on success, triggers a 'created' event which provides the final\n        wl_buffer to the client.\n      - on failure, triggers a 'failed' event to convey that the server\n        cannot use the dmabufs received from the client.\n\n      For the 'create_immed' request,\n      - on success, the server immediately imports the added dmabufs to\n        create a wl_buffer. No event is sent from the server in this case.\n      - on failure, the server can choose to either:\n        - terminate the client by raising a fatal error.\n        - mark the wl_buffer as failed, and send a 'failed' event to the\n          client. If the client uses a failed wl_buffer as an argument to any\n          request, the behaviour is compositor implementation-defined.\n\n      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and\n      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes\n      may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.\n      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in\n      the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.\n      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the\n      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the\n      interface version number is reset.","summary":"factory for creating dmabuf-based wl_buffers"},"requests":[{"type":"request","name":"destroy","requestType":"destructor","description":{"type":"description","text":"Objects created through this interface, especially wl_buffers, will\n        remain valid.","summary":"unbind the factory"},"args":[]},{"type":"request","name":"create_params","description":{"type":"description","text":"This temporary object is used to collect multiple dmabuf handles into\n        a single batch to create a wl_buffer.
